# Dog Breed Prediction

## Introduction

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting dog breeds from images. The source code for this project is adapted from a Kaggle competition, with additional contributions made by Vidhi Agarwal to enhance its functionality and performance.

## Description

Using deep learning techniques, the model is trained on a dataset of dog images to accurately classify breeds. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference code, enabling users to deploy the trained model for real-world dog breed classification tasks.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes scripts for data loading, augmentation, and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for training.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the dog breed classification model.
- **Evaluation:** Provides evaluation metrics and scripts to assess the performance of the trained model.
- **Inference:** Includes scripts for making predictions on new dog images using the trained model.
- **Deployment:** Offers guidance on deploying the trained model for practical applications.
